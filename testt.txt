1. Why do you want to pursue an MS-MIS degree at Mays Business School?The MS-MIS program at Mays Business School without any doubts is one of the best Information Management programs in the US. I am eager to study in this program not only because of its immediately focus on technology courses, but also stems from its emphasis on applying technical skills into real-life practices via capstone project and internships. The curriculum of the MIS program at TAMU is compelling to me, not only because of its immediate focus on both business and technology via core courses such as Management Information Systems, Business Communication, Database Programming, and Business Programming Logic and Design, but also due to its broad electives including Business Object Oriented Programming with Java and Supply Chain Management. The Information Systems Project course, which combines theoretical methodology and practical exercises, will uniquely reinforce my understanding of the management of information systems.In conclusion, the strong innovation atmosphere in Texas, the highly practical curriculum of the MIS program, and the great networking opportunities make this program an ideal choice for me.2. What are your career goals, and how will this degree help you achieve those goals?In the short term, I would like to work as an information system analyst in a consulting company. With professional training in information technology and business management, I will be able to understand clients¡¯ needs and use a variety of techniques to build new information systems or improve the performance of existing systems. I believe I can build solid analytical, technical, management, and interpersonal skills by participating in various projects in different industries. My long-term goal is to head a consulting company dedicated to helping small businesses and start-up companies operate efficiently and effectively.Pursuing a career in information system management and sticking to it will be my way of securing a successful future. I am confident that enrolling in your prestigious MIS program will help me build technical, strategic management, and leadership skills, which are essential for me to work as an information systems analyst in the short term, and to run an independent consulting company in the future. And I look forward to learning from alumni and classmates who share similar goals with me, and to being inspired by these brilliant people.3. Describe your background and personal/professional accomplishments, and how they demonstrate your potential for success in this degree and your career.Several years ago, while watching the Olympics on TV in my hometown in central China, I became fascinated by the volleyball games and dreamed that one day I would play this sport. However, at that time there was no volleyball pavilion in the whole county. When I enrolled at Nankai University, I began playing volleyball and eventually joined the Business School¡¯s volleyball team. Over the last three years, I spent most of my weekends and holidays practicing. This past October, I led my team to the championship in the Nankai Men¡¯s Volleyball Competition. My scholastic journey in the field of information system management is very similar to playing volleyball: dream big and start small. Having experienced the dramatic changes that information technology brought to my daily life and the economic development of my county, I was eager to learn and to use this powerful tool to make the world even better.My undergraduate studies included both business and technology courses. These courses not only helped me to acquire a combined knowledge of business and technology, but also provided me with plenty of opportunities to use my technical skills to improve management efficiency and business performance in my course-related projects. In the third year of my program, I carried out a project on predictive data mining. By using a dataset with 41,188 records collected from a phone call marketing campaign conducted by a Portuguese bank1, I attempted to predict whether or not the client would subscribe for a term deposit. I established data mining models by using SPSS modeler, and used the C5.0 decision tree model and the neural network model to analyze the dataset. As a result of these analyses, both models successfully predicted the outcome with over 90% accuracy.I am not only eager to acquire knowledge and skills related to my major, but I am also dedicated to incorporating them into extracurricular and real-life practices. In June 2014, I volunteered to assist the Admission Manager of Nankai University with facilitating recruitment in the Jincheng District. By collecting and analyzing admission data from the previous years, I decided to target students whose National University Entrance Exam scores were 80-100 points higher than the admission score line. Then I selected 30 prospective students and invited them to a one-on-one interview session with the Admission Manager. In 2014, the number of admissions to Nankai University from Jincheng increased from 6 students to 13. I also worked as a summer intern in a company that runs two gas stations. According to company businesses, I created a SQL Server database in Visual Studio using C# and built a basic system to calculate daily gross sales according to different types of fuel. This simple system saved a manager at least 40 minutes per day from checking the total sales. This experience encouraged me to pursue further education in order to develop the skills necessary to build more complex information systems and provide affordable technical support to small businesses and start-up companies.I hope my enthusiasm and academic training can gain me the honor of studying at Texas A&M University. I believe that only by enrolling in your prestigious MIS program will I gain the skills I need to work as an Information System Analyst in the short term, and to run an independent consulting company in the future. As I embark on this stage of my life, I have many dreams and ambitions to benefit society. Each course and project that I was involved in during the last three years is a small step towards my short term goal. I believe education from the MIS program will offer me invaluable experience that will allow me to realize my greater long-lasting dreams.4. Describe an ethical dilemma that you have personally encountered. What alternatives did you consider, and why? DO NOT tell us what you decided to do.When I worked as an intern in a small company that runs two gas stations in my hometown, I faced a challenge of communicating modern information management ideas with the management team. I tried to persuade them to use an information management system to manage customer, finance and sales information. However, they refused my suggestion for the reason that a comprehensive information system was too expensive and they were satisfied with the current situation.I analyzed the underlying reasons for their decision. All three of the management team were born in the 1960s. They got used to the manual accounting and operation management methods and didn¡¯t have an opportunity to learn and use information systems in the early decades of their career. Therefore, they didn¡¯t have a deep understanding of how an information system works and what benefits it has. As a management information system major, I clearly realize how much a successful information system can benefit my company, but I am worried that if I continue to put suggestions to managers, they will be weary of my words. As the old saying goes: ¡°Facts speak louder than words¡±. To demonstrate the advantages of information systems, I stopped to persuade them and designed a simple system to track daily gross sales. I also compared this system with the traditional calculation method and found out that this system was much more effective and accurate. Then I introduced this simple software to the management team and showed them the comparative results. They were persuaded by the fact and considered to purchase a comprehensive information system if it can be offered at an affordable price. I have learned that facts are more persuasive than emotion and words.Required Admission Essay                                         Chu Wu
